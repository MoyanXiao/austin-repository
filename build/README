This file provides brief instructions on how to use the .make to build your 
own project. 

First, all the source should be put at the right place. Makefile is put at the root
of companent directory, header files ./include and source ./src.

Second, edit the Makefile. a simple Makefiles as follows:

	# 1 --> set the ROOT micro and build sripts directory
	ifndef ROOT
	ROOT=../..
	unexport ROOT
	endif
	BUILD_SCR=${ROOT}/build
	
	# 2 --> include the common.make file for environment setting and build dependency 
	include ${BUILD_SCR}/common.make
	
	# 3 --> add extra header search path
	# INCLUDE_DIRS += ....
	
	# 4 --> add extra library file or path
	# STATIC_LINK_FILES += ...
	# LIBRARY_PATHS += ...
	
	# 5 --> set the TARGET file
	TARGET=${BINDIR}/HelloWorld${EXEEXT}
	
	
	# 6 --> include .make for source file searching and target building 
	include ${BUILD_SCR}/common-src-found.make
	include ${BUILD_SCR}/common-task.make

Third, build the project:
	common build task(including dependencies):
		% make
		or 
		% make all
		
	with debug information
		% make debug
		
	others, see common-task.make
	
	
That's it. Enjoy
